            <p class="card-text">Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.

                "What are you doing out here honey?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.
                
                "I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.
                
                The wolf was just as charming as her ex but she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself.  After getting his Instagram, she rushed down the path to her Grandma's house. 
                
                The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...
                
                The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.
                
                "What takes you so long?  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that you ran away with some mythology creatures into the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.
                
                The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!
                
                The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears.
                
                A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice.
                
                "It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."
                
                "Oh how lovely!  Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.
                
                When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could scarcely recognize her Grandmother.</p>
