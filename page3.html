              <p class="card-text">"Grandmother!  Your voice sounds so odd.  Is something the matter?" she asked.

                  "Oh, I just have touch of a cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point.
                  
                  "But Grandmother!  What big ears you have," said Little Red Riding Hood as she edged closer to the bed.
                  
                  "The better to hear you with, my dear," replied the wolf.
                  
                  "But Grandmother!  What big eyes you have," said Little Red Riding Hood.
                  
                  "The better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf.
                  
                  "But Grandmother!  What big teeth you have," said Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly.
                  
                  "The better to eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed and began to chase the little girl.
                  
                  Little Red Riding Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but a hungry wolf a while ago. Her grandmother was not a soft spoken person.
                  
                  She ran across the room and through the door, shouting, "Help!  Murder!" as loudly as she could.
                  
                  A woodsman who was chopping logs nearby heard her scream and ran towards the cottage as fast as he could.
                  
                  He grabbed the wolf and choked it until it spit out the poor Grandmother who was a bit frazzled by the whole experience, but still in one piece."Oh Grandma, I almost get you killed!"  sobbed Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll never flirt with strangers or dawdle in the forest again."
                  
                  "What are you crying about? I have warned you a thoundsand times but you never listen. Thank goodness you shouted loud enough for this kind woodsman to hear you, now I have enough food for weeks!"
                  
                  Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother had a nice lunch and a long chat.</p>
