          <p class="card-text">Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.

              One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.
              
              "That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.
              
              When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.
              
              "Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't visit your boyfriend today and please don't flirt with strangers!  The woods are dangerous."
              
              "Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."
              
              But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some pretty boys in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She approached some guys and they flirted with eachothers for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and exchanged phone numbers. 
              
              Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...</p>
